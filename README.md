# Overview

This is a plugin that renders diagrams from your selection in Sublime Text 2
or 3.

By default, it binds the Alt-D key (preview diagram) and registers a command on the Command Palette. Place your cursor in your diagram or select lines of text and trigger the command. Multiselections are allowed. Multiselections are allowed.  

To generate diagrams, simplely press Ctrl-B, you will get diagrams in the same directory with source file.

If you wish to override the viewer used, disable start-time sanity checks, or
change the default character set for diagram files, search "Diagram Settings" in Command Palette, copy settings from "default settings" to "user settings", change any one as you wish.

## Operations

Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> to preview.

Preview mode **tend to** preview the **current** diagram, unless you select part of a diagram (more the one line) or more than one diagram.

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>B</kbd> to build diagrams for current file.

Build Command **tend to** build **all** diagrams unless you select some of them or part of a diagram.

## Preview of new syntax  & Side by side viewing (multiple column)

This is a preview for activity diagram with "**Monokai Extend**" color scheme.

Side by side viewing is a more convenience way to edit plantuml diagrams. Each time you view the diagram, the result will refresh in the right one place, no popup window or new view.

![mult_col_view](./samples/mult_col_view.png "mult_col_view")

**STEP 1**

*If you are using sublime text 3 and keep the default diagram plugin settings, you can ignore this step.*
{style=color:brown;}

Make sure you are using sublime text 3 and have followed settings:

    "viewer" : "Sublime3Viewer", 
    "format": "png" // png, svg, eps, latex

**STEP 2**

press <kbd>alt</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> to preview diagram; press <kbd>alt</kbd> <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>2</kbd> to switch to 2 columns; drag the preview to new column.

## Preview of **Goto Symbol**

Press  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd> to list all diagram titles in current file.

Perfectly deal with complex titles. Same process in using title as file name.
